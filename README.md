# Introducing ZUUM: CreateZoomTask's successor

What started out as a simple Zoom meeting task scheduler extension has become ZUUM, a full-on meeting management hub!

# Features:
1. Create meeting tasks that you can run at the press of a button. This will start the meeting if you are logged in as the host, and join if you are not.
1. Set run times to automatically start or join meetings on a fixed schedule.
1. Modify or delete meetings and run times.

# Installation
## Windows
Simply download the installer and run it. ZUUM requires administrator privileges to access task scheduler, but the installer will create an elevated shortcut on your desktop so you don't have to provide permission every time you launch. 

## MacOS
Download the dmg and open it. Drag the ZUUM application to your applications folder and run it. You are then free to unmount and delete the dmg.

# Compatibility
ZUUM is compatible with both Windows and MacOS (On 10.15 Catalina)! A Linux version may be in the workings, so stay tuned! We will also be adding support for older Macs in the next update.
