# Introducing ZUUM: CreateZoomTask's successor

What started out as a simple Zoom meeting task scheduler extension has become ZUUM, a full-on meeting management hub!

# Features:
1. Create meeting tasks that you can run at the press of a button. This will start the meeting if you are logged in as the host, and join if you are not.
1. Set run times to automatically start or join meetings on a fixed schedule.
1. Modify or delete meetings and run times.

# Installation
Simply download the installer and run it. ZUUM requires administrator privileges to access task scheduler, but the installer will create an elevated shortcut on your desktop so you don't have to provide permission every time you launch. 

# Compatibility
Currently, ZUUM only works on Windows. A macOS version is in the works, so stay tuned for that!
