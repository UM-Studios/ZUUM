# Introducing ZUUM: CreateZoomTask's successor

What started out as a simple Zoom meeting task scheduler extension has become ZUUM, a full-on meeting management hub!

# Features:
1. Create meeting tasks that you can run at the press of a button. This will start the meeting if you are logged in as the host, and join if you are not.
1. Set run times to automatically start or join meetings on a fixed schedule.
1. Modify or delete meetings and run times.

# Installation

## Windows
Simply download the ZUUM-1.0.0-setup-win.exe and run it. 

## MacOS
Download ZUUM-Installer-1.0.0.dmg and open it. Follow the steps in HowToInstall.txt for further instructions

# Compatibility
ZUUM works for both Windows and MacOS (on 10.15 Catalina and 11.0.0 Big Sur)! A Linux version may be in the works, so stay tuned for that. We will also be adding support for older Macs in a future update.

# Issues
If you find any issues, please let us know! Github has a special [issues page](https://github.com/UM-Studios/ZUUM/issues) just for this, so if you find an issue, head over there and create a new issue. We'll be addressing these as soon as possible!
